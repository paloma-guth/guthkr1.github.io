    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this exploration of the power testing, I could better understand its significant role in study design and interpretation. By estimating the sample size needed to detect meaningful effects, power analysis ensures the reliability of research outcomes and can also avoid waste of funds. By making use of a two-sample t-test with randomly generated data, I aimed to identify significant differences between groups and assess the t-test’s sensitivity.\nThrough this project, I gained insight about the importance of simulations and their relevance in real-life scenarios.\n\nThings I learned while testing the code\nIn this project, I used set.seed() function to generate the random data. After multiple rounds of testing and additional research, I discovered that this function plays a crucial role in maintaining the reproducibility of our results. This means that while the specific data points within each group may vary slightly due to random variation, the overall pattern and properties of the data will remain the same. It’s important to note that without setting the seed, each time we run the code, we introduce a new source of randomness into the data generation process. As a result, each execution would generate a different random data, leading to variations in the outcomes of our power analysis and also in the plots.\n\n\nExtra\nAfter conducting multiple simulations with different parameter values, it became evident that as the means of the two groups gets closer, the power curve tends to exhibit a more gradual slope rather than a steep incline, as showed in the first graph. After some research and pondering about the meaning of this, I came to the conclusion that this observation suggests that when the means of the groups approach parity, the t-test becomes less sensitive in detecting these smaller differences, leading to a less pronounced increase in statistical power.\nThe impact of proximity in mean values between groups is evident and can be observed in the graph below. The simulation that produce the following graph made use of a random data generation that have means with only one-unit difference."

This shows a preference for declarative reporting over investigative journalism. This linguistic emphasis suggests a straightforward approach to news delivery, where the focus lies on conveying information rather than delving into deeper investigative narratives.\n\n\nUnited States: Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining the word cloud generated from headlines sourced from Reuters, a renowned international news agency, reveals a notable emphasis on the term “coronavirus.” This focus aligns with the global concerns during the analyzed period, highlighting Reuters’ commitment to reporting on significant global events. Additionally, the word cloud reflects the agency’s expansive international coverage, as evidenced by the words “China” and “Iran”, indicating a broad editorial perspective that encompasses news from various countries and regions.\n\n\nUnited States: ABC News\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word cloud derived from headlines sourced from ABC News illustrates a predominant focus on the term “coronavirus,” reflecting the widespread attention given to the pandemic across various news outlets. However, ABC News, a major American news network, also incorporates a diverse range of topics and events into its coverage. This editorial approach suggests a commitment to providing comprehensive news coverage in the context of the United States territory.\n\n\nUnited States: Breitbart News\n\n\n\n\n\nBreitbart News, an auto-declared right-wing news outlet, demonstrates a distinct editorial stance and coverage emphasis through its word cloud analysis. Notably, the prominence of terms such as “Trump” underscores the publication’s focus on political news and commentary. Additionally, the inclusion of terms like “impechment” and “democrats,” absent in other datasets, hints at Breitbart’s extended engagement with topics related to politics. This emphasis on political discourse and distinct coverage priorities aligns with Breitbart’s reputation as a conservative news source catering to a specific audience demographic."
