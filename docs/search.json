    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this exploration of the power testing, I could better understand its significant role in study design and interpretation. By estimating the sample size needed to detect meaningful effects, power analysis ensures the reliability of research outcomes and can also avoid waste of funds. By making use of a two-sample t-test with randomly generated data, I aimed to identify significant differences between groups and assess the t-test’s sensitivity.\nThrough this project, I gained insight about the importance of simulations and their relevance in real-life scenarios.\n\nThings I learned while testing the code\nIn this project, I used set.seed() function to generate the random data. After multiple rounds of testing and additional research, I discovered that this function plays a crucial role in maintaining the reproducibility of our results. This means that while the specific data points within each group may vary slightly due to random variation, the overall pattern and properties of the data will remain the same. It’s important to note that without setting the seed, each time we run the code, we introduce a new source of randomness into the data generation process. As a result, each execution would generate a different random data, leading to variations in the outcomes of our power analysis and also in the plots.\n\n\nExtra\nAfter conducting multiple simulations with different parameter values, it became evident that as the means of the two groups gets closer, the power curve tends to exhibit a more gradual slope rather than a steep incline, as showed in the first graph. After some research and pondering about the meaning of this, I came to the conclusion that this observation suggests that when the means of the groups approach parity, the t-test becomes less sensitive in detecting these smaller differences, leading to a less pronounced increase in statistical power.\nThe impact of proximity in mean values between groups is evident and can be observed in the graph below. The simulation that produce the following graph made use of a random data generation that have means with only one-unit difference."
